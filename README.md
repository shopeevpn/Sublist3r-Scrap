# Sublist3r-Scrap

Sublist3r-Scrap is a fork of Sublist3r which also implements scraping for each page. Just input the domain (or load a domain list from a file), and it will take a **screenshot** of each web page, in the ports specified, trying both **HTTP** and **HTTPS**

## Installation

- Sublist3r-Scrap uses the Firefox geckodriver, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Once downloaded, the decompressed file needs to be on the same folder as the python script. Once decompressed, run the following script to add it to the path, from the main folder:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
```

- Sublist3r-Scrap needs the selenium and other libraries, which can be downloaded via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
usage: scrap.py [-h] [--domain DOMAIN] [--url_list URL_LIST]
